# Sentiment-driven-Stock-Index-Modelling-and-Prediction-Integrating-News-and-Numerics

The integration of news content and headlines with stock market analysis has evolved significantly over time, transitioning from basic statistical methods to sophisticated sentiment analysis tools. This project delves into the influence of news sentiment on the Indian stock market indices (NSE/BSE) and aims to develop predictive models for forecasting future index values based on sentiment scores. By leveraging extensive historical news data from The Economic Times archives spanning from January 1, 2021, to February 22, 2024, the project employs techniques such as web crawling and scraping, parallelization, and the development of a streamlined scraping application. Sentiment analysis is conducted using VADER and DistilBERT models to understand the emotional tones underlying news headlines and articles and their impact on the Nifty 50 index. The study entails data preprocessing, model building, and lag analysis to uncover the relationship between sentiment scores and index values. It seeks to identify prevailing sentiment trends in financial news articles, assess their impact on stock index movements, and examine the correlation between sentiment scores and index fluctuations. Furthermore, the project aims to determine which domains of news have a more pronounced effect on stock index movements, offering insights into the dynamics of the Indian stock market landscape. By integrating diverse news content with stock features, the project endeavors to enhance predictive accuracy, providing valuable insights for navigating the complexities of today's stock market environment. Ultimately, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the interplay between news sentiment and stock market movements, facilitating more informed decision-making for investors and analysts alike.
